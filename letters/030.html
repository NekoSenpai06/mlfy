          <p>it's 12:00am early in the morning, i have read all your letters na pala gabi, kaya binabasa ko yan nang ganitong oras kasi alam kong iiyak ako. alam mo ba whenever i read your letter lagi akong nakikinig ng music, hinding hindi mawawala yan pag nag babasa ako ng letters mo. Maria Clara by Sugarcane, the first time i listened to that masterpiece i knew it'll be my new favorite song, kahit hindi ako marunong gusto kitang isayaw sa kanta na yon. ikaw kaya yung lagi kong naiisip every time na pinapakinggan ko yon, each words or phrase sa song na yon sayo naka tuon. <i>"oh ikaw ang pinaka magandang dalaga na aking nasilayan"</i> yes, that is my favorite part of the song, because it is true that you are the most beautiful girl that i've seen, you are so beautiful inside and out, hindi ko alam pero unlike other girls out there you are different, ni hindi ko na masabi na you are one in a million kasi you are truly rare, it's like you are a special one, the one that God created just for me. others can see your beauty but only the outside one, kasi ako i already saw that beauty na hirap makita nang iba sayo, the inside, i saw how you love, how you care for someone, how you bring joy to others, i saw how you try your best even though the process will hurt you. hindi mo alam pero you are way more beautiful than you think</p>
