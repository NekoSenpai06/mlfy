          <p>it's been a month since October 31st when we saw each other again. the moment i laid eyes on her, it felt like i glimpsed my future. everything seemed to slow down as i approached her, it was as if i were in a dream. is this real? it is. i couldn't move, my head, my eyes were completely captivated by her beauty, her eyes, her face, her hair, her skin, her voice everything about her looked so perfect. that moment was unforgettable, seeing the person you love, the person who means everything to you, once again.</p>
